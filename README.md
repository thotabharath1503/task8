# Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard (2015–2024)

## Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly Power BI dashboard designed to analyze 10 years of sales and profit data from a Superstore dataset. The dashboard provides insights into sales and profit trends across different regions and categories, helping to understand key business performance metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is named `Superstore_Sales_10Y.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- **Order Date**: Date of the order
- **Region**: Region where the sale occurred
- **Category**: Product category
- **Sales**: Sales amount for each order
- **Profit**: Profit for each order

## Steps I Took

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**:
   - Imported the CSV data into Power BI.
   - Cleaned the data to ensure it was structured for analysis.
   
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Changed the date format for better time-based visualizations.
   - Created a new **Month-Year** column using DAX for displaying monthly trends.
   
3. **Dashboard Design**:
   - **Cards**: Displayed key performance indicators (KPIs) for total sales and profit.
   - **Bar Chart**: Visualized sales by region.
   - **Pie Chart**: Showed the distribution of sales by category.
   - **Line Chart**: Displayed the monthly sales trend.
   
4. **Styling**:
   - Applied a soft background, borders, and clear titles for readability.
   
## Insights

- **Total Sales**: ₹10,003.6
- **Total Profit**: ₹1,000.73
- **Top Categories**: Technology and Office Supplies
- **Top Regions**: South and West
- **Highest Sales Period**: Between 2015–2016

## Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Basic DAX** for calculated columns
- Simple layout with cards, charts, and text

## Future Improvements

- Add slicers for filtering by year, region, and category.
- Include tooltips for detailed hover information.
- Format numbers with currency symbols.
- Add buttons for page navigation (e.g., details page).
